# Levitate Blinds Card

A premium, custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant specifically designed for **Top-Down Bottom-Up (TDBU)** blinds, such as the Smartwings Levitate series. 

Traditional cover cards in Home Assistant only support a single position slider, making TDBU blinds awkward to control. This card solves that by providing a unified, visual, and intuitive interface that mirrors the physical blinds.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Editor Support:** Fully editable from the Home Assistant UI! No YAML required.
- **True-to-Life Visualization:** A dynamic window graphic that shows the actual fabric moving up and down as you adjust the rails.
- **Dual Independent Sliders:** Vertical sliders for both the Top Rail and Bottom Rail.
- **Group Support:** Works perfectly with Home Assistant Native Cover Groups to control an entire room's top or bottom rails simultaneously.
- **Themeable:** Respects your Home Assistant theme variables (card background, primary colors, text colors).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add the card to your dashboard using the manual YAML editor or the visual editor.

### Dual-Bar Blinds (TDBU - Top-Down Bottom-Up)

```yaml
type: custom:levitate-blinds-card
name: Kitchen Window
top_entity: cover.kitchen_blinds_top
bottom_entity: cover.kitchen_blinds_bottom
```

### Single-Bar Blinds (Standard)

For standard blinds that only have one moving bar (going from top to bottom), simply omit the `top_entity` property.

```yaml
type: custom:levitate-blinds-card
name: Bedroom Window
bottom_entity: cover.bedroom_blinds
```

For top-moving blinds, omit the `bottom_entity` property.

```yaml
type: custom:levitate-blinds-card
name: Skylight
top_entity: cover.skylight_blinds
```

### Room Group Control (Advanced)

If you have multiple TDBU blinds in one room (e.g., Left, Center, Right), you can control them all at once! 

1. Create a **Cover Group** Helper for all your Top rails (`cover.den_blinds_top_group`).
2. Create a **Cover Group** Helper for all your Bottom rails (`cover.den_blinds_bottom_group`).
3. Use those groups in the card:

```yaml
type: custom:levitate-blinds-card
name: Den Blinds (All)
top_entity: cover.den_blinds_top_group
bottom_entity: cover.den_blinds_bottom_group
```

## 🎨 Theming & Styling

This card automatically adapts to your active Home Assistant theme. If you want to customize it further using `card-mod`, the following CSS variables are utilized:

- `--ha-card-background` / `--card-background-color`: The main background of the card.
- `--primary-color`: The color of the "fabric" and the slider thumbs.
- `--secondary-background-color`: The background color of the window frame/track.
- `--primary-text-color`: The color of the main title.
- `--secondary-text-color`: The color of the percentage labels.
- `--ha-card-border-radius`: The rounding of the card corners.

---

## 🛠️ How it Works

The card assumes your `cover` entities use a standard 0-100 `current_position` attribute where:
* `100%` means the rail is fully at the **top** (ceiling).
* `0%` means the rail is fully at the **bottom** (floor).

When you slide the Top rail down, it sends a `set_cover_position` command to lower the percentage. When you slide the Bottom rail up, it increases the percentage. The blue "fabric" is dynamically drawn between the two rail coordinates.
